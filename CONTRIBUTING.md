# Contributing to faceit-python

Bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests are welcome.

## How to Contribute

- Open issues for bugs, questions, or feature requests.
- Submit pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements.
- Adding models for resource methods is highly appreciated, as this enables returning validated objects rather than raw data. For methods without models, prefer using the raw version for clarity.
- Improvements to documentation and examples are also valuable.
- Include tests for new functionality.

## Guidelines

- Review the project's code style and structure before submitting changes.
- Discuss significant changes via an issue before starting work.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Document any new or modified functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
