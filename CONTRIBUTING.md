# Contributing to faceit-python

Thank you for your interest in improving **faceit-python**!
We welcome contributions of all kinds â€“ bug fixes, documentation, new features, and more.

## Code Style & Quality

- **Consistency:** Please follow the existing code style and conventions throughout the codebase.
- **Linting:** Use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting.
- **Type Checking:** Use [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking.
- **Testing:** Tests are written with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/). High test coverage is encouraged; please add or update tests where appropriate.
- **Dependencies:** Managed with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Always work inside the uv environment and use uv for installing/updating dependencies.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** All commits are checked using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting work, always run:
>
> ```
> make setup
> ```
>
> This will create the virtual environment, install all dependencies, and set up pre-commit hooks.
>
> **No Make? (e.g., Windows):**
> Run these commands manually:
>
> ```
> uv venv --python 3.8.0
> uv sync --all-extras
> pre-commit install
> ```
