"""
NOTE: This example does not work with the current version (0.1.0) of the
library. Please wait for release 0.1.1 for this feature.

Backport 0.1.1:
Do not use the enum `faceit.MaxConcurrentRequests.ABSOLUTE` â€” replace it with
the constant `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_ABSOLUTE_ABSOLUTE` from `AsyncClient`.

The `max_items` parameter is not available yet, and instead of a list,
the method returns an iterator. To get a list, you need to call
`await championships.collect()`.

Use this at your own risk, as in version 0.1.1 the iterator is not initially
limited, so it may return a very large list.
